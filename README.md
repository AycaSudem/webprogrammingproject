Project Theme

This project is a multi-page blog website built entirely with HTML5 for the Web Programming course.
It covers seven categories: Travel, Fashion, Photography, Art, Astronomy, Career, and Events.

The main goal is to practice and demonstrate mastery of HTML structures, including semantic tags, forms, tables, navigation, and media embedding.

File Organization

The project structure is organized as follows:

├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── services.html
├── README.md
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       ├── about.jpg
│       ├── art1.jpg
│       ├── astronomy1.jpg
│       ├── banner.jpg
│       ├── career1.jpg
│       ├── event1.jpg
│       ├── fashion1.jpg
│       ├── photo1.jpg
│       └── travel1.jpg


Challenges Faced

Structuring a navigation menu and category sections without CSS.

Keeping the layout readable using only HTML tags.

Correctly implementing semantic elements on the About page (figure, details, time, aside, blockquote, etc.).

Organizing the projects table with <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

Making a fully functional contact form using only HTML elements.

How to Run

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

Navigate through pages using the menu and category links.

No installation or server setup is required — the website runs entirely in the browser.
